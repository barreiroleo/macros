## Features

I write this tool for running and recording complex demos from terminal. At moment has capabilities for basic stuff like:
- Get active window
- Select window
- Send key pressing by sync way with custom delays.
- Logging stuff for tracking your scripts.
- Specific actions for resizing selected windows.
- Toggling recording for OBS (ctrl+r shortcut used).

The architecture isn't good structured for multiple purposes. I want refactoring for extensibility in a future, I don't have time now.
